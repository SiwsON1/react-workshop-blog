Welcome to my React and Redux-based blog application! This project focuses on CRUD functionality, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete posts. On the main page, you'll find a list of blog posts. Clicking on a post takes you to a dedicated page for that entry. There, you can edit or delete the post using corresponding buttons. The application is styled using Bootstrap components, making it aesthetically pleasing while allowing me to focus primarily on logic and data management. Whether you're a recruiter or just interested in the tech stack, this project showcases a wide range of skills and best practices</p>
